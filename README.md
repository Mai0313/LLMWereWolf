An AI-powered Werewolf (Mafia) game with support for multiple LLM models and a beautiful Terminal User Interface (TUI).

## Features

- üéÆ **Complete Game Logic**: Full implementation of Werewolf game rules with 20+ roles
- ü§ñ **LLM Integration**: Abstract interface for easy integration with any LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.)
- üñ•Ô∏è **Beautiful TUI**: Real-time game visualization using Textual framework
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable**: Multiple preset configurations for different player counts
- üìä **Event System**: Comprehensive event logging and game state tracking

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Werewolf

uv run llm-werewolf --preset 9-players

# Start a 6-player game without TUI
uv run llm-werewolf --preset 6-players --no-tui

# Enable debug panel
uv run llm-werewolf --debug

# View help
uv run llm-werewolf --help
```

## Configuration

### Using Presets

```bash
# Available presets
uv run llm-werewolf --preset 6-players   # Beginner (6 players)
uv run llm-werewolf --preset 9-players   # Standard (9 players)
uv run llm-werewolf --preset 12-players  # Advanced (12 players)
uv run llm-werewolf --preset 15-players  # Full game (15 players)
uv run llm-werewolf --preset expert      # Expert configuration
uv run llm-werewolf --preset chaos       # Chaotic role mix
```

### Custom Configuration

Create a custom configuration in Python:

```python
from llm_werewolf import GameConfig

config = GameConfig(
    num_players=9,
    role_names=[
        "Werewolf",
        "Werewolf",
        "Seer",
        "Witch",
        "Hunter",
        "Villager",
        "Villager",
        "Villager",
        "Villager",
    ],
    night_timeout=60,
    day_timeout=300,
)
```

## Integrating Your Own LLM

The package provides an abstract `BaseAgent` class that you can implement for any LLM:

```python
from llm_werewolf.ai import BaseAgent


class MyLLMAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "my-model"):
        super().__init__(model_name)
        # Initialize your LLM client here

    def get_response(self, message: str) -> str:
        # Call your LLM API here
        # message contains the game prompt
        # return the LLM's response
        response = your_llm_api_call(message)
        return response


# Use in game
from llm_werewolf import GameEngine
from llm_werewolf.config import get_preset

config = get_preset(9)
engine = GameEngine(config)

players = [(f"player_{i}", f"AI Player {i}", MyLLMAgent()) for i in range(config.num_players)]

roles = config.to_role_list()
engine.setup_game(players, roles)
```

## TUI Interface

The TUI provides real-time visualization of:

- **Player Panel** (Left): Shows all players, their AI models, and status
- **Game Panel** (Top Center): Displays current round, phase, and statistics
- **Chat Panel** (Bottom Center): Shows game events and messages
- **Debug Panel** (Right): Shows session info, config, and errors (toggle with 'd')

### TUI Controls

- `q`: Quit the application
- `d`: Toggle debug panel
- Mouse: Scroll through chat history

## Game Flow

1. **Setup**: Players are assigned random roles
2. **Night Phase**: Roles with night abilities act in priority order
3. **Day Discussion**: Players discuss and share information
4. **Day Voting**: Players vote to eliminate a suspect
5. **Check Victory**: Game checks if any camp has won
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until victory condition is met

## Victory Conditions

- **Villagers Win**: When all werewolves are eliminated
- **Werewolves Win**: When werewolves equal or outnumber villagers
- **Lovers Win**: When only the two lovers remain alive

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies
uv sync --group test

# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/core/test_roles.py -v
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
uv sync --group dev

# Run linters
uv run ruff check src/

# Format code
uv run ruff format src/
```

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture:

- **Core**: Game logic (roles, players, state, engine, victory)
- **Config**: Game configurations and presets
- **AI**: Abstract agent interface for LLM integration
- **UI**: TUI components (Textual-based)
- **Utils**: Helper functions (logger, validator)
